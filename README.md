# CodeAlpha_MyRecipeBot_Project
This project is a recipe recommendation bot that suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have available. By analyzing the ingredients you provide, it identifies recipes you can make, even if some ingredients are missing. The bot displays relevant recipe images and lists common and missing ingredients for each suggestion.
